                What goal do you wish to achieve in AltSchool?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The goals I wish to achieve in AltSchool are:
            <ol>
                <li>To fully immerse myself in AltSchool Africa's rigorous academic
                    programs which would enable me excel academically and attain the highest levels of academic
                    excellence. </li>
                <li>To get internships and network with people in the field.</li>
                <li>To be able to build a cloud infrastructure from scratch.</li>

            </ol> 
            </p>
		           I know it would require grit, a whole lot of work and it would be be
                stressful, but it would be done.
